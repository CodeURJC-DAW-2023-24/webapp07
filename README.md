<h2>
  üéØ Main aspects
</h2>

<h3>
  üë§ Entities
</h3>

- User
- Investment
- Project
- Comment
- Review

<h4>
  üë• Relations
</h4>

- A user makes an investment into a project
- A user leaves a comment on a project

<h3>
  üîê User permissions
</h3>

- **User:** Can invest in projects or upload/delete theirs. They can post comments on any project available.
- **Guest:** Can log in, sign up or see the projects available to invest.
- **Admin:** Unlimited access, is the owner of all the entities.

<h3>
  üñºÔ∏è Images
</h3>

- **Project pictures:** A gallery of pictures which allows the Project Owner to show information about his/her project.
- **User profile picture:** A picture which identifies each user.

<h3>
  üìä Graphics
</h3>

- **Progress bar:** Monitorize the status of the objective.
- **Pie chart:** Shows the percentage of money invested by each investor.

<h3>
  ü§ñ Complementary technology
</h3>

- **Email:** Email notifications for users.
- **PDF:** Generates a PDF summarizing the user¬¥s transactions.

<h3>
  ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced algorithm or query
</h3>

- **Recommendation:** Users will be recommended projects which they are likely to donate to. This will be made using a greedy algorithm, that allows a 1% less likeliness between users' previous donations in each iteration, until a sufficient numbers of users are encountered to make the suggestions.

<h3>
   Diego
</h3>

**Tasks:** 
- I created mustache templates from the previous phase HTMLs.
- I developed the Image class along with its functionality, enabling the management of multiple photos in the database. Additionally, I implemented the necessary controllers to display photos from the database.
- I implemented web security measures, including the functionality for the login and signup pages.
- I designed a controller that runs universally, inserting data required in the header for each controller.
- I assisted in providing examples for the data initializer.
- I introduced the functionality for editing profiles, as well as the ability to change the template style.
- I contributed to resolving errors related to photos during the editing and creation of projects. Moreover, I revamped the associated templates.
- I integrated an email service, allowing our application to send emails to users when signing up or when their project reaches its goal.
- I developed controllers to handle general errors and created templates for login errors and general errors.
- I optimized the codebase by removing redundant code and templates. This involved redesigning some functions and templates to perform differently when necessary while retaining shared functionality.
