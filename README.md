   Diego

**Tasks:** 
- I created the mustache templates from the previous phase HTMLs.
- I developed the Image class along with its functionality, enabling the management of multiple photos in the database. Additionally, I implemented the necessary controllers to display photos from the database.
- I implemented web security measures, including the functionality for the login and signup pages.
- I designed a controller that runs universally, inserting data required in the header for each controller.
- I assisted in providing examples for the data initializer.
- I introduced the functionality for editing profiles, as well as the ability to change the template style.
- I contributed to resolving errors related to photos during the editing and creation of projects. Moreover, I revamped the associated templates.
- I integrated an email service, allowing our application to send emails to users when signing up or when their project reaches its goal.
- I developed controllers to handle general errors and created templates for login errors and general errors.
- I optimized the codebase by removing redundant code and templates. This involved redesigning some functions and templates to perform differently when necessary while retaining shared functionality.
